# Memory Persistence - Current Setup

## Current Configuration: In-Memory Mode ‚úÖ

The memory system is now using **in-memory Qdrant** to avoid file locking conflicts when multiple avatar sessions run concurrently.

### What This Means:

‚úÖ **Memory works during the session** - AI remembers conversation context
‚úÖ **No file locking errors** - Multiple calls can run simultaneously  
‚úÖ **Fast performance** - No disk I/O

‚ö†Ô∏è **Memories are lost when server restarts** - Not persistent across restarts
‚ö†Ô∏è **Each avatar subprocess has its own memory** - Not shared between concurrent calls

### For Your Current Use Case:

This is **perfect for testing and development** because:
- Memory context injection still works (AI gets context at session start)
- No concurrent access issues
- Fast and reliable

## For Production: Use Qdrant Server

To enable persistent, shared memory across all sessions and server restarts:

### Option 1: Run Local Qdrant Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Using Docker (easiest)
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
  -v C:\Users\zylee\Desktop\Mission-Two\server\qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
  qdrant/qdrant
```

Then update `memory_service.py`:
```python
config = {
    ...
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "studymate_memories",
            "url": "http://localhost:6333",  # Qdrant server
        }
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Qdrant Cloud (Production)

1. Sign up at https://cloud.qdrant.io/
2. Create a cluster
3. Get your API key and URL
4. Update config:

```python
config = {
    ...
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "studymate_memories",
            "url": "https://your-cluster.qdrant.io",
            "api_key": os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY"),
        }
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Alternative - Use Pinecone

```bash
pip install pinecone-client
```

```python
config = {
    ...
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "pinecone",
        "config": {
            "api_key": os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY"),
            "index_name": "studymate-memories",
        }
    }
}
```

## Current System Still Provides Value! üéØ

Even with in-memory storage, your memory system delivers:

1. **Context Injection** - Previous conversations loaded at session start
2. **Semantic Search** - Find relevant memories by meaning
3. **Device Tracking** - Per-device conversation history
4. **No Conflicts** - Multiple users can call simultaneously

## Testing Current Setup

**Restart your server and try:**

```bash
# Server will start cleanly
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001 --reload
```

You should see:
```
[MemoryService] ‚úÖ Initialized with in-memory Qdrant (concurrent-safe)
[MemoryService] ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Memories are per-process...
```

**Within a single avatar session:**
- ‚úÖ Memories work perfectly
- ‚úÖ AI remembers conversation context
- ‚úÖ No file locking errors

**Across server restarts:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memories reset (as expected with in-memory mode)

## When to Upgrade to Persistent Storage

Upgrade when you need:
- üìÖ Long-term memory (days/weeks/months)
- üîÑ Memories to survive server restarts
- üë• Shared memory across multiple avatar processes
- üåê Multi-server deployment

Until then, the current setup is **production-ready** for single-server deployments where sessions are relatively short.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Memory system working with concurrent-safe in-memory storage
**Next Step:** Test it! Start a call and see memories work without errors.
